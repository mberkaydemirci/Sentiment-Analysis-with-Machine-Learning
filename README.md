# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning
In this study, it is aimed to perform sentiment analysis by applying text representation methods to e-commerce customer comments, since there are few natural language processing studies in the literature on Turkish language.
Large web data from sources such as product reviews on an e-commerce site are good sources for researching deep learning. This study investigates the performance of word2vec Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify comments on products on e-commerce sites as positive or negative as a person's sentiment analysis. Using two word embedding algorithms, Word2vec, Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram, we generated the CNN with the CBOW model and the Skip-gram model. We measured classification accuracy using both CBOW and Skip-grams for reviews on purchased items. Experimental results showed that word2vec significantly improved the accuracy of the classification model. The accuracy of the Skip-Gram model was higher and more stable compared to the CBOW model. After calculating the best k score for Manhattan and Euclidean vector distance metrics, it was seen that the Manhattan metric gave more optimal results by using the k-nn algorithm.
